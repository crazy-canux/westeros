WMI
===

`[WMI] <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394582(v=vs.85).aspx>`_ is Windows Management Instrumentation.

`[subprocess] <https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/subprocess.html>`_ is standard python library for WMI.

`[sh] <https://github.com/amoffat/sh>`_ is the best third party library to replace subprocess.
